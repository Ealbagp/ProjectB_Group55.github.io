    Now that we've highlighted the strong link between air pollution and asthma, it's time to focus on how this issue has evolved and who it impacts the most.

    Our interactive map lets you explore how pollution and asthma rates have shifted over time across NYC neighborhoods, revealing two key emerging patterns.

            <h3>The Positive</h3>
            <p>Air pollution across New York has steadily declined in recent years, driven by environmental policies and the shift toward cleaner energy. This encouraging trend marks a meaningful step toward a healthier, more livable city.</p>

            <h3>The Negative</h3>
            <p><strong>Environmental Health Isn't Equal.</strong>

              Not all communities are exposed to pollution in the same way. <strong>Research shows that low-income and historically marginalized populations</strong>, including Black, Latino, and immigrant communities, are more likely to live in areas with <strong>higher PM2.5 levels</strong>.<br><br>
              
              Understanding these disparities is key to creating fairer, healthier cities. Use this map to explore not just the <strong>where</strong>, but the <strong>why</strong> behind pollution and asthma in NYC.<br><br>

      <h3>Unveiling the Hidden Patterns</h3>
      <p>
          In this set of interactive charts, we offer an in-depth look at how air pollution (PM2.5) and asthma cases have evolved over time across various neighborhoods in New York City. Through two visual approaches, you'll be able to explore the data more clearly:
      </p><br>
      <p><strong>1. Constant Scale to Observe Improvement:</strong>
          In this chart, the pollution scale remains fixed over time, allowing you to see how air quality in the city has improved. You'll be able to identify areas where pollution has decreased year after year, highlighting progress toward cleaner air.
      </p>

      <p><strong>2. Yearly Reset Scale to Highlight Affected Areas:</strong> In this chart, the pollution scale resets each year, making it easier to identify neighborhoods with the highest pollution levels during each period. This approach allows you to clearly visualize the areas most impacted by pollution and how the most vulnerable communities continue to be the most affected.

        <p>
            You can navigate the data in the map through the following features:
        </p><br>
        <p class="feature-description">
            <strong>üî¥ Red heat zones:</strong> Represent PM2.5 concentrations, the deeper the red, the worse the air quality.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-description">
            <strong>üîµ Blue circles:</strong> Mark the number of asthma cases within a neighborhood, scaled by the number of asthma-related visits.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-description">
            <strong>üìÖ Year Dropdown:</strong> Adjust the year slider to move through time and see how pollution and asthma rates have changed over the years.
        </p>
        <p class="feature-description">
            <strong>üåç Socio-Economic Layer Toggle:</strong> Fade out wealthier neighborhoods to highlight low-income areas, showcasing the disproportionate burden on marginalized communities.
